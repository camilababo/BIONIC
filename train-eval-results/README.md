This directory houses the results obtained from the training and evaluation procedure conducted with the [BIONIC](https://github.com/bowang-lab/BIONIC) algorithm. These files span from feature matrices generated during training, gene modules and ARI/AMI score plots. The [BIONIC-evals library](https://github.com/duncster94/BIONIC-evals/tree/45d5b7f4f4713d9312af4ad7c56ac98338b466a3a) was employed to evaluate the module detection task, as detailed the [evaluation script](https://github.com/duncster94/BIONIC-evals/blob/45d5b7f4f4713d9312af4ad7c56ac98338b466a3/bioniceval/evals/module_detection.py). You'll find several folders, each corresponding the outcomes obtained from the different input networks tested to enhance module detection scores.
